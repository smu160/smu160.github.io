      Hey, I’m Saveliy Yusufov. I first started this blog shortly after I finished college to 
      document the fascinating ideas I encountered as a new software engineer. Although I paused 
      for a while, recent learning experiences have reignited my passion for sharing these insights. 
      Sometimes I find neat ways to optimize code using a bunch of different resources to help me, 
      and this blog now serves as a way to document the solutions and my experiences.

      >

      If you’re curious about me, I took a non-traditional path after high school. Shortly after 
      finishing high school, I went into the army, where I served as an 
      [Army Ranger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Ranger_Regiment). I never desired 
      to go to college, and I always thought I’d go into the medical field (at the behest of my family). 
      In a twist of fate, I discovered programming. That motivated me to go to college to study computer
      science once I transitioned out of the service. I pursued a CS & Math combined major to prove to
      myself that I'm not just bad at math (yes, I loathed math in high school and even failed multiple 
      math classes).

      Shortly after I started programming, I became consumed by the idea of making my code as performant as 
      possible. Initially, this obsession took the form of fixing low-hanging fruit in code (e.g., 
      replacing sequential lookups in a large array with a hashmap). Once I discovered the joys of concurrency
      and parallelism, I became obsessed with leveraging them to improve performance as well. My latest 
      obsession has been SIMD. Namely, utilizing SIMD to achieve significant performance improvements.
