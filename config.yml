    Content: "> Hey, I'm Saveliy Yusufov. I first started this blog shortly after I finished college as a means of 
    keeping track of the neat ideas I learned throughout my time in college, and as a new software engineer. For a 
    myriad of reasons, I didn't continue to blog; however, I've been learning so many neat things over the past year, 
    that I felt I'd be remiss if I didn't start jotting down all these new ideas and thoughts.
   
   
    > If you're curious about me, I took a non-traditional path after high school, but I still ended up in college.
    Although I always thought I'd go into medicine (at the behest of my family), I somehow ended up majoring in 
    computer science and math. 


    > Shortly after I started programming, I became consumed by the idea of making my code as performant as possible.
    In the beginning, this obsession took the form of fixing low hanging fruit in code (e.g., replace sequential lookups in a 
    large array with a hashmap. Then, I began to learn about concurrency and parallelism. Nowadays, I've begun to
    dive deeper into performance analysis and optimization. Sometimes I find neat ways to optimize code using a bunch
    of different resources to help me, and this blog will serve as a way to write up my experiences."
